Microsoft Audio Watermarking Tool Version 1.0

This tool is based upon the publication:

D. Kirovski and H.S. Malvar. 
Spread Spectrum Watermarking of Audio Signals. 
IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Vol.51, (no.4), pp.1020–33, 2003.

As mentioned in the publication, it displays solid robustness against traditional 
signal processing, including arbitrary limited pitch bending and time-scaling. 
However, targetted procedures such as watermark estimation or the replacement 
attack can wipe out the watermark while preserving perceptual fidelity. 

See license.txt for details about the end-user legal agreement.
